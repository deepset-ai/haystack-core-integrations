name: Project release on PyPi

# The pushed tag must be formatted like so:
# * nodes/speech2text-v1.0.0
# * stores/foo-documentstore-v1.2.3
#
# The first part must be the path of the project being released.
# If we want to release version 1.0.0 of project text2speech
# that lives in path nodes/text2speech we'd have to push a
# nodes/text2speech-v1.0.0 tag.
