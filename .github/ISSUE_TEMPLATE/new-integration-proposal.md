## Summary and motivation

Briefly explain the request: why do we need this integration? What use cases does it support?

## Detailed design

Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with Haystack to understand, and for somebody familiar with
the implementation to implement. Get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.
Also, if there's any new terminology involved, define it here.
