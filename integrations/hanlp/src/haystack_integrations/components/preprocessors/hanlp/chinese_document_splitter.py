class ChineseDocumentSplitter:
    """
    A DocumentSplitter for Chinese text.

    'coarse' represents coarse granularity Chinese word segmentation, 'fine' represents fine granularity word
    segmentation, default is coarse granularity word segmentation.

    Unlike English where words are usually separated by spaces,
    Chinese text is written continuously without spaces between words.
    Chinese words can consist of multiple characters.
    For example, the English word "America" is translated to "美国" in Chinese,
    which consists of two characters but is treated as a single word.
    Similarly, "Portugal" is "葡萄牙" in Chinese, three characters but one word.
    Therefore, splitting by word means splitting by these multi-character tokens,
    not simply by single characters or spaces.

    ### Usage example
    ```python
    doc = Document(content=
        "这是第一句话，这是第二句话，这是第三句话。"
        "这是第四句话，这是第五句话，这是第六句话！"
        "这是第七句话，这是第八句话，这是第九句话？"
    )

    splitter = ChineseDocumentSplitter(
        split_by="word", split_length=10, split_overlap=3, respect_sentence_boundary=True
    )
    splitter.warm_up()
    result = splitter.run(documents=[doc])
    print(result["documents"])
    ```
